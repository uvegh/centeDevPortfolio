        For a limited time only, on Samsung.com/Shop Samsung App, pre-order or purchase a new qualifying Galaxy device (“Qualifying Purchase”), send in your qualifying trade-in <br> device to Samsung through the Samsung Trade-In Program, and if Samsung determines your trade-in device meets all eligibility requirements, you will receive a trade-in credit specific to your qualifying trade-in device to apply toward your Qualifying Purchase.Device models that <br> currently qualify for trade-in and trade-in credit amounts associated with those models are available on Samsung.com and the Shop Samsung App; eligible models and amounts may change at Samsung’s sole discretion. To be eligible<br> for trade-in, your qualifying device must meet all Trade-In Program eligibility requirements, which include, but are not limited to, that the device powers on, holds a charge, and does not power off unexpectedly; has a functioning <br> display; has no breaks or cracks in the screen (unless a cracked screen offer applies); has no breaks or cracks in the case; has no liquid damage (whether visible or not); has no other defects that go beyond normal wear and tear; is not <br> on a black list; has a verified FCC ID; has been reset to factory settings; has all personal information removed; has all software locks disabled; and is owned by you (leased devices are not eligible). Anticipated trade-in value will be <br>applied as a credit at time of purchase, but, if you do not send in your trade-in device within 15 days of receipt of your Qualifying Purchase, you will be charged back for the trade-in credit applied to your purchase, or if you send in your <br> trade-in device within 15 days of receipt of your Qualifying Purchase but Samsung determines your device does not meet all eligibility requirements, you will be charged back for the trade-in credit applied to your purchase minus $25.<br> Participation in this program does not excuse you from contracts with your carrier or retailer (or any related payments or fees) for the device that was traded in.
