In this project you are to use your knowledge of
Media Query as your web page should be responsive across all screen sizes
JavaScript validation and conditions extensively
You will also be required to integrate chart (Chart.js) – after the calculation of the points of the students the points will have to be broken down to show points on every criterion. Which will be displayed  












|| score1 == "" ||score2 == "" ||score3 == "" ||score4 == "" ||score5 == ""
